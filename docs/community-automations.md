`*` There is an additional optimization that prevents more than one bot message per hour to not overwhelm issue comment section

**`/assign` command** applies to all external contributors (close contributors, issue creators). Detected when the comment contains `/assign` as a standalone word (`/assign me` matches, `/assignee` does not). All `/assign` Slack activity goes to `#support-dev-notifications` only.

**`/assign` cross-repo limit:** Contributors can have up to 2 assigned issues across all community repos (`COMMUNITY_REPOS`). Issues unassigned within the last 7 days count toward the limit (`currentAssignments + recentUnassignments >= MAX_ASSIGNED_ISSUES`).

In `scripts/constants.js` set:
- `BOT_MESSAGE_ISSUE_NOT_OPEN`: _Issue not open for contribution_ message text
- `BOT_MESSAGE_ALREADY_ASSIGNED`: _Issue already assigned_ message text
- `BOT_MESSAGE_ASSIGN_SUCCESS`: Assignment confirmation message
- `BOT_MESSAGE_ASSIGN_NOT_GOOD_FIRST_ISSUE`: Decline message for non-good-first-issue issues
- `BOT_MESSAGE_KEYWORD_GOOD_FIRST_ISSUE`: Keyword reply with `/assign` guidance

# `good-first-issue-comment`

- Deletes any previous guidance comment from the bot before posting a new one
- Identified by the `<!-- ASSIGN_GUIDANCE -->` HTML comment marker
