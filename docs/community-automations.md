`*` There is an additional optimization that prevents more than one bot message per hour to not overwhelm issue comment section

`**` `/assign` applies to all external contributors (close contributors and issue creators included). Core team members never reach the script. `/assign` must be the entire comment (trimmed, case-insensitive). All `/assign` Slack activity goes to `#support-dev-notifications` only.

**`/assign` cross-repo limit:** Contributors can have up to 2 assigned issues across all community repos (`COMMUNITY_REPOS`). Issues unassigned within the last 7 days count toward the limit (`currentAssignments + recentUnassignments >= MAX_ASSIGNED_ISSUES`).

In `scripts/constants.js` set:
- `BOT_MESSAGE_ISSUE_NOT_OPEN`: _Issue not open for contribution_ message text
- `BOT_MESSAGE_ALREADY_ASSIGNED`: _Issue already assigned_ message text
- `BOT_MESSAGE_ASSIGN_SUCCESS`: Assignment confirmation message
- `BOT_MESSAGE_ASSIGN_NOT_GOOD_FIRST_ISSUE`: Decline message for non-GFI issues
- `BOT_MESSAGE_KEYWORD_GOOD_FIRST_ISSUE`: Keyword reply with `/assign` guidance

# `good-first-issue-comment`

Posts a guidance comment when the `good first issue` label is applied to an issue (triggered via the `manage-issue-header` workflow). Explains the `/assign` command, issue limits, cooldown, and links to contributing guidelines.

- Only posts if the issue also has `help wanted` label
- Deletes any previous guidance comment from the bot before posting a new one
- Identified by the `<!-- ASSIGN_GUIDANCE -->` HTML comment marker

In `scripts/constants.js` set:
- `BOT_MESSAGE_GOOD_FIRST_ISSUE_GUIDANCE`: Guidance message text

# `contributor-pr-reply`

Sends reply to a community pull requests.

In `scripts/contants.js` set:
- `BOT_MESSAGE_PULL_REQUEST`: Message text

# `holiday-message`

Sends a holiday message to community pull requests and issue comments.

In `scripts/contants.js` set:
- `HOLIDAY_MESSAGE`: Message text

Before/after holidays, enable/disable all related workflows in all repositories that use it (search for `call-holiday-message`).
