  `👋 Hi @${author}, thanks for contributing! \n\n **For the review process to begin, please verify that the following is satisfied:**\n\n- [ ] **Contribution is aligned with our [contributing guidelines](https://learningequality.org/contributing-to-our-open-code-base)**\n- [ ] **Pull request description has correctly filled _AI usage_ section & follows our AI guidance:**\n\n    <details>\n    <summary><b><i>AI guidance</i></b></summary>\n\n    <br>\n\n    **State explicitly whether you didn't use or used AI & how.**\n\n    If you used it, ensure that the PR is aligned with [Using AI](https://learningequality.org/contributing-to-our-open-code-base/#using-generative-ai) as well as our DEEP framework. DEEP asks you:\n\n    - **Disclose** — Be open about when you've used AI for support.\n    - **Engage critically** — Question what is generated. Review code for correctness and unnecessary complexity.\n    - **Edit** — Review and refine AI output. Remove unnecessary code and verify it still works after your edits.\n    - **Process sharing** — Explain how you used the AI so others can learn.\n\n    <br>\n\n    Examples of good disclosures:\n\n    > "I used Claude Code to implement the component, prompting it to follow the pattern in ComponentX. I reviewed the generated code, removed unnecessary error handling, and verified the tests pass."\n\n    > "I brainstormed the approach with Gemini, then had it write failing tests for the feature. After reviewing the tests, I used Claude Code to generate the implementation. I refactored the output to reduce verbosity and ran the full test suite."\n\n    </details>\n\nAlso check that issue requirements are satisfied & you ran \`pre-commit\` locally. \n\n**Pull requests that don't follow the guidelines will be closed.**\n\n**Reviewer assignment can take up to 2 weeks.**`;
